<h2>Create a New Column</h2>

The great thing about pandas DataFrames is how easy it is to create new columns based on calculated values of others.
<br><br>

Take the DataFrame from the last task, we could easily add a new column to display the 3 people's BMI.
<br><br>
For Example:<br>
<em><b>data['BMI'] = data['weight']/(data['height']**2)</b></em>

<br><br>
Copy this line into the python file and see the output.
