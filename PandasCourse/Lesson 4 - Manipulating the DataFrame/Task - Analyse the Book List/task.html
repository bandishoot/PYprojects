<h2>Analyse the Booklist</h2>

You have been provided with the book list for Ivanhoe Grammar School.
<br>
Your task is to:
<ul>
    <li>Read in the data</li>
    <li>Assign to a new dataframe just the columns: Year Level, Subject, RRP (see Lesson 1)</li>
    <li>Restrict the rows to only the core subjects of English, Mathematics, Science and Humanities. The condition statement will require the .isin() method (google it)</li>
    <li>Group the data by Year Level to find out which year level has the biggest book list bill for their core subject.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<br>
Verify with your teacher before you check this task.
