<h2>Bar Charts</h2>
To show plots from your DataFrames you need to import a graphical package. Matplotlib is the most commonly used in Python. It's default settings are quite basic, however it is highly adaptable. Other packages can draw more professional charts without as many alterations, and we would encourage you to explore them <a href="https://mode.com/blog/python-data-visualization-libraries/">here</a>


<p>
    At the top of your page import the matplotlib package and in particular import the pyplot sublibrary:<br>
    <em><strong>import matplotlib.pyplot as plt</strong></em>
</p>

<p>
    Plotting with the pandas DataFrame is straight forward, simply use the .plot() method. To specify which type of plot you want called the kind property inside the method brackets.

<p>
For Example:<br>
<em><strong>data.plot(kind="bar")</strong></em>
</p>

<p>
To display the chart ensure you instruct the plot to show<br>
    <em><strong>plt.show()</strong></em>
