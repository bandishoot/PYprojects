<h2>Grouped Data</h2>

You have been provided a survey of 50 people and their journey times via the mode of transport they commute to work.
<br><br>

To group the data by mode of transport the following code can be used:<br>
<em><b>data.groupby("Mode")</b></em>
<br><br>

NOTE: this will not return anything unless you add one of the statistical methods, eg .sum(), .count(), .mean(), .max() to the end.
