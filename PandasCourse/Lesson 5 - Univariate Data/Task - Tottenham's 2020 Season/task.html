    To plot specific columns only, either create a new DataFrame listing the columns required or list them as:
    <em><strong>data[["GF","GA"]].plot()</strong></em>


    <br>
    <br>
    <strong>Extension</strong><br>
    Can you plot a bar chart of one of the categorical columns (Day, Result or Captain).<br>
