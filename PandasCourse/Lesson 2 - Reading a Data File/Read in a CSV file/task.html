<h2>Read in a CSV File</h2>
The majority of the situations when we are analysing data, we're handling much more than is efficient to be typing out regularly between software. <br>

One of the most common forms of data file is a comma-separated value (CSV) file. These are simply plain text files with a table like structure with each field separated by a comma and each row of the table is a new line in the file. <br>
<br>

Pandas can read a CSV file and covert the information to a DataFrame with a single instruction. <br><br>

<h3>CSV Files with a Header Row</h3>
Most CSV files have a header row with the title of each field. Pandas handles this by default and use these titles has the column names.
<br><br>
For Example<br>
try running the following line<br>
<em><b>data = pd.read_csv("healthData.csv")</b></em>
