<h2>Restricting Rows</h2>

A DataFrame can have it's rows restricted in one of two ways:
<ul>
    <li>By index using the .iloc object</li>
    <li>By a condition on one of the fields</li>
</ul>

<br>
<h3>By Index</h3>
A slice of the rows can be selected by their index number using the .iloc object<br>
For Example<br>
To return lines 3,4 and 5 you could use:
<em><b>data.iloc[3:6]</b></em><br>
Note: Python never includes the end of the range

<br><br>
To return a single row, say row 8, either of the following could be used (they return different structures):
<ul>
    <li><em><b>data.iloc[8:9]</b></em><br></li>
    <li><em><b>data.iloc[9]</b></em><br></li>
</ul>
Test them in the Python file to investigate.

<br><br>

<h3>By Condition</h3>
The syntax for this is slightly unusual. <br>
A condition is created, say the order quantities exactly equal to 10: data['Qty'] == 10 <br>
This creates a list of row number. This condition is then inserted into square brackets after the DataFrame name. <br>
<br>
For Example:<br>
<em><b>data[data['Qty'] == 10]</b></em><br>
This then return just the orders where the quantity is equal to 10.
