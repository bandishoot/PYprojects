<h2>Boxplots</h2>

Boxplots are another way to visualise the distribution of datasets. These essentially draw a box and whisker plot of the 5-figure summary listed as the final items of the summary statistics seen earlier in the course. Try to print these out to the terminal screen and run the program.

<em>Hint</em><br>
<em><strong>data.describe()</strong></em>

<p>
    To change the type of plot, as before alter the kind argument in the .plot() method.<br>
    <em><strong>data.plot(kind="box")</strong></em>
</p>

<p>Play around with the plot: adding titles; changing colors; plotting two charts instead of one (which is better in this case -why?).<br> Check your final plot with your teacher.</p>
