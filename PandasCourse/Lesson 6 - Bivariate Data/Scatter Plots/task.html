<h2>Scatter Plots</h2>

<p>To analyse bivariate data, usually a scatter plot is required to visualise the relationship and whether it's linear or not.</p>

<p>Once again, to change the type of chart, alter the kind argument of the .plot() method. However, the plot needs to be instructed which way round to have the axes. It is usual to have the explanatory variable on the horizontal axis; in this case NumStudents:<br>
<em><strong>data.plot(kind="scatter", x="NumStudents", y="NumTickets")</strong></em></p>

<p>As before, play around with the plot and check with your teacher.<br>
