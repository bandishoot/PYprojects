<h2>Selecting Specific Fields</h2>

To select specific fields added them as a list (separated by commas inside double square brackets) to the right-hand-side of the DataFrame name.<br><br>

For Example, <br>to list just the height and weight fields, you could do:<br>
<em><b>data[['height','weight']]</b></em>
