<h2>Read a CSV with No Header</h2>

Occasionally a CSV file will contain just raw data and will require all the rows to be read as data into the DataFrame, giving you no columns names (we'll handle that shortly).
<br><br>
Should these situation occur, simply adding <em><b>header=None</b></em> to the <em>read_csv</em> method will ensure the pandas library doesn't try to assign column names.
<br><br>
For Example<br>
try running the following line<br>
<em><b>data = pd.read_csv("healthNoHeader.csv", header=None)</b></em>
